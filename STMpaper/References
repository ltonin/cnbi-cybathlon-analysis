1) Brain oscillations control hand orthosis in a tetraplegic 2000
5 months, 1 subject SCI, unkown sessions but twice per week, learning claimed but not shown

2) Initial on-line evaluations of the LF-ASD brain-computer interface with able-bodied and spinal-cord subjects using imagined voluntary motor potentials.
2 sessions, 2 subjects SCI, no learning

3) ‘Thought’ – control of functional electrical stimulation to restore hand grasp in a patient with tetraplegia
"Several months", 1 subject SCI, learning claimed not shown

4) Control of a two-dimensional movement signal by a noninvasive brain-computer interface in humans
two disabled users SCI, 68 and 25 sessions (plus more in previous studies), learning claimed but not shown, only last 3 sessions for results

5) Brain-actuated interaction (Jose's speller + robot): 
not longitudinal (5 sessions?), learning claimed not shown

6) EEG-based neuroprosthesis control: a step towards clinical practice.
1 SCI patient, only 3 days, learnign shown with accuracy, not features

7) Towards a user-friendly brain-computer interface: initial tests in ALS and PLS patients
6 patients, 1-2 sessions, no learning claimed, actually the oppsoite (zero training)

8) Self-Paced (Asynchronous) BCI Control of a Wheelchair in Virtual Environments: A Case Study with a Tetraplegic
not longituidnal, single day, 1 SCI, no learning claimed or shown

9) Patients with ALS can use sensorimotor rhythms to operate a brain-computer interface
20 sessions, accuracy increase shown, 4 ALS

10) Emulation of computer mouse control with a noninvasive brain–computer interface
Two disabled SCI, 14-38 sessions, learning claimed but not really shown, again like in 2004 paper results only on last 3 sessions

11) Brain–computer interface controlled gaming: Evaluation of usability by severely motor restricted end-users.
4 patients, 5 sessions, results not great, learning claimed on the grounds of accuracy

12) Motor Imagery for Severely Motor-Impaired Patients: Evidence for Brain-Computer Interfacing as Superior Control Solution
6 sessions, 4 patients, show features and accuracy over sessions but not so much learning present, theu are Berlin and boost about the ML methods instead

13) A Co-Adaptive Brain-Computer Interface for End Users with Severe Motor Impairment
22 (!!!) patients, but 1 session, no learning could be shown but interesting that they discuss vs our paper 2013 (Robert)

14) Functional Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed Upper Extremity After Spinal Cord Injury by Noninvasive Hybrid Neuroprostheses
1 patient, few sessions (not said), but it points to studies with users (no application)

15) Discrimination of Motor Imagery-Induced EEG Patterns in Patients with Complete Spinal Cord Injury
No application, 8 SCI patients + 7 healthy, shows that SCI are worse, perfect to cite, no learning shown (single day)

16) Changes in movement-related β-band EEG signals in human spinal cord injury
Same here, there is also correlation with ASIA, showing the more the impairment the worse the patterns, no learning shown

17) Noninvasive Electroencephalogram Based Control of a Robotic Arm for Reach and Grasp Tasks
This is with healthy!!! It should not be included nornmally. I can show it to say that they also do not show better modulation of features (only application performance over time)

18) Vidaurre C, Sannelli C, Müller K-R and Blankertz B 2011 Machine-learning-based coadaptive calibration for brain–computer interfaces Neur. Comput. 23 791–816
I put also this to show that whnever they show some discriminancy it is for very few sessions and quite questionable on the impact
