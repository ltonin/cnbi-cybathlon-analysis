1) OK Eric's final race problems
2) OK Say Numa did more online than race, Eric the opposite, another argument in favour of incremental learning
3) OK Stablity vs performance
4) OK Infrequent BCI retraining, only two classifiers per subject -> shift importance to subject learning
5) OK Stress that time matters in BCI training
6) OK Mention that the discriminancy increase is where we selected the features, i.e., it was real operand learning
7) OK Incremental training credited with effectiveness
8) OK (more or less, I mention paraameterization, it is enough) Correlation discirmnancy vs top are not bigger becase this furhter depends on parmaeterization of the BCI
9) OK Increase in Comm Acc might all be control paradigm, but increase of Spin and Jimp cannot be explained by that and must be due to mutual learning
10) OK Trade-off IC/INC through parameterization
11) OK Features selected where learning is shown 
12) OK Maybe admit that also the modulation intiially is important
