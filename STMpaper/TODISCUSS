1) Eric's final race problems
2) Say Numa did more online than race, Eric the opposite, another argument in favour of incremental learning
3) Stablity vs performance
4) Infrequent BCI retraining, only two classifiers per subject -> shift importance to subject learning
5) Stress that tiem matters in BCI training
6) Mention that the discriminancy increase is where we selected the features, i.e., it was real operand learning
